# Excel-Dynamic-Dashboard
I utilize a sales-related dataset to produce a dynamic dashboard in Excel.

The sample dataset has ~1,000 rows and 7 columns, containing information pertaining to Dates, Stores, Salespersons,
Products, Quantities, Prices, and Total Sales. 

To analyze this dataset, I created Pivot Tables for analysis. Using the Pivot Tables, I created Pivot Charts 
like Donut Charts to represent Sales Distribution by Product, Bar Charts to represent Aggregate Sales by Store,
Column Charts to represent Aggregate Sales by Month, and Clustered Column Charts to represent
Total Sales by Store by Sales Representative. 

I aggregated all of the Pivot Charts into a Dashboard. Similarly, the visualizations are dynamic in nature because 
I reported connections among information & I created Slicers to dynamically see the information you would like to explore in real time. 

While this is a small dataset, it is theoretically possible to build out something similar to scale. This was more or less a proof of concept.

Edit: I recently created something very similar in the Financial Analyst Case Study Repository with a much larger dataset & more advanced concepts.
